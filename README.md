# Password Generator
This is a simple password generator application that generates a random password with a length of 10 characters. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## User Story
* AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
* I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
* SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security



## Usage
To use the password generator, simply click the "Generate Password" button on the page. The password will be generated and displayed in the text field.

## How It Works
The password generator works by randomly selecting characters from a set of allowed characters. By default, the set of allowed characters includes lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers. The length of the password is set to 10 characters, but this can be easily modified by changing the length variable in the JavaScript code.

## Customization
If you would like to customize the password generator, you can modify the JavaScript code. For example, you could add additional characters to the charset variable to include special characters, or you could prompt the user to input the desired password length.
